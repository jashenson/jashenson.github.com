{"id":1754,"imageId":1732,"number":"A-29","description":"This H&E specimen was taken from the monkey trachea.  Plates or rings of hyaline cartilage are seen supporting the trachea.  Hyaline cartilage is the most widespread type of cartilage forming nearly all of the fetal skeleton and persisting in the adult in costal cartilages, the cartilages of the nose, trachea, bronchi and the articular cartilages of joints.  Fine collagenous fibers are scattered throughout the ground substance but aren't usually visible in H&E preparations.  Thus, the ECM appears relatively homogenous.  The cartilage cells are called chondrocytes and lie within little spaces or caves called lacunae.  Hyaline cartilage, except in articular joints is surrounded by a dense CT capsule, the perichondrium.  In this specimen, note the large lacunae in the deeper portion of the cartilage. The lining of a lacuna is referred to as a capsule. The lacunae contain chondrocytes whose cytoplasm may be distorted and vacuolated.  The vacuoles represent former sites of glycogen and lipid, which were dissolved during tissue processing. In the living condition, a chondrocyte completely fills its lacuna, but in fixed preparations most cells are shrunken and have an uneven or ragged appearance. Identify a cell nest (two or more chondrocytes in the same lacunae) and, an isogenous group (two or more chondrocytes lying close together but in separate lacunae and representing the offspring of a single chondrocyte).  Note the basophilic territorial matrix around isogenous groups of chondrocytes and the more acidophilic perichondrium.  The perichondrium consists of an outer fibrous layer and an inner cellular layer. The cellular layer becomes less prominent after cartilage is full grown, and in later life the perichondrium may consist of only a fibrous layer. Keep in mind that the perichondrium is a source of new chondrocytes, which make it possible for cartilage to grow by the appositional method.  The presence of a muscle layer internal to the cartilaginous plates suggests that this is distal trachea or even a large bronchus.","thumb":"http://digitalmicro.mc.vanderbilt.edu/WebSlides/Pettepher/A-29/PreviewSlide.jpg","tissue":"Trachea","stain":"H&E"},

It is primarily demonstrating the process of intramembranous ossification (a type of bone formation occurring lateral and dorsal to the nasal chambers).  Mesenchymal cells can be found in the most cell poor regions between developing bone (red-stained spicules) and skin.  There is a lot of space between individual cells.  Note the absence of connective tissue fibers in these regions.  Locate the osseous tissue (staining pale red) and note that it is called spongy or cancellous bone.  This type of bone is characterized by many spaces between the trabeculae or bony spicules.  Study several bony spicules and the intervening CT to identify the various cell types found in developing bone.  Osteoblasts, osteocytes, osteoclasts and osteogenic cells are found regardless of the site of formation. Osteoblasts, which secrete osteoid and enable the calcification of the bony matrix, line the trabecular surfaces, usually in a single row. Some of these cells have become entrapped within lacunae in the newly deposited bone matrix and have thus become osteocytes. They function to maintain bone.  They occupy lacunae and their cytoplasmic processes extend into small canals called canaliculi.  They have dark nuclei and a pale cytoplasm.  In some spicules, one may observe resorption of bone from the ends of the trabeculae or occupying shallow excavations in their surface (Howship's lacunae).  Resorption of bone is accomplished by osteoclasts, multinucleated cells with marked acidophilia that rest directly on the surface of the bone.   Osteogenic cells (also referred to as osteoprogenitor cells) are stem cells which lie in the connective tissue between the trabeculae.  The cytoplasm and nuclei are pale staining.  These cells differentiate from mesenchymal cells and multiply by mitosis before becoming osteoblasts.  Osteogenic cells, osteoblasts, and osteocytes are different functional stages of the same cell.  The change from one of these cells to another is reversible.","thumb":"http://digitalmicro.mc.vanderbilt.edu/WebSlides/Pettepher/A-35/PreviewSlide.jpg","tissue":"Fetal head","stain":"H&E"},

Study the five zones of cartilage associated with endochondral ossification.  Remember, calcified cartilage stains purple, the matrix of bone is red, and hyaline cartilage is pink, though cartilage is more basophilic in most H & E slides. 1. Zone of reserve cartilage. This is typical hyaline cartilage and is a large zone in this preparation.2. Zone of cell proliferation (ZP). The cartilage cells are small and tend to be arranged in columns, which run parallel to the long axis of the cartilage.  This arrangement is indicative of their intense mitotic activity.  3. Zone of cell and lacunar maturation and hypertrophy enlargement (ZH). Chondrocytes and lacunae are larger than in the previous zone.  The chondrocytes increase in size and resorb some their lacunar walls, enlarging them to such an extent that some of the lacunae become confluent.  4. Zone of calcification (ZC). This is a small zone having a slightly darker appearance than the preceding zone due to the basophilic staining of the calcified cartilage.  The chondrocytes die in this zone.5. Zone of cartilage removal and bone deposition. Osseous elements are present among the pieces of calcified cartilage. Study the synovial joint and attempt to identify its various parts. The joint capsule can be seen around the joint area where it fits like a sleeve over the end of each cartilage model. The joint capsule consists of two layers (commonly called fibrous capsule of the joint) and the inner stratum is the synovial membrane. The fibrous layer is composed predominately of collagenous fibers, which extend from the periosteum of one bone of the joint to the periosteum of the other bone of the joint. Sharpey’s fibers help anchor the collagenous fibers to the underlying bone.  The synovial membrane attaches to the periphery of the articular cartilage but does not extend over the free surfaces of the articular cartilage. Prominent infoldings of the synovial membrane into the joint cavity are called synovial cells. They secrete the synovial fluid, which fills the cavity in life. The cells can undergo mitosis and completely repair the membrane in case of injury. Synovial cells, in addition to being randomly distributed in the membrane, are often concentrated and aligned along the inner surface of the membrane to produce the appearance of epithelium. Electron micrographs show, however, that the cells rest among collagenous fibers rather than on a basement membrane. The synovial membrane is richly supplied with blood and lymphatic vessels.

One characteristic feature of adult compact bone is the presence of central Haversian canals which run longitudinally within the substance of bone and contain the blood vessels which nourish the osteocytes. Central canals are surrounded by 4-20 successive layers of bone known as concentric lamellae.  A central canal and its associated concentric lamellae constitute a unit of bone structure called the Haversian system or osteon.  Cementing lines demarcate the boundaries of adjacent Haversian systems.  The difference in appearance of lamellae is believed to be due to the arrangement of the collagen fibers which course longitudinally in one lamella and run transversely or circularly in the adjacent lamella.  This alteration in fiber direction adds great strength to bone.  Besides the concentric lamella, two other types of lamellae can be identified:  interstitial lamellae and circumferential lamellae. The interstitial lamellae occupy irregular spaces between the systems of concentric lamellae and represent angular fragments of older Haversian systems which have been partially destroyed in the internal reorganization of the bone.

Unlike skeletal muscle, it is involuntary, consists of a network of branching fibers with centrally located nuclei, has cross striations which are closer together and less prominent than those in skeletal muscle, and possesses intercalated disks.  Study longitudinal, cross and oblique sections of cardiac muscle under different magnifications.

An intercalated disk is a 0.5 to 1 μm thick, undulating or step-like band, which crosses the fiber at the level of the Z-band. It has been shown by electron microscopy to be the point of junction between two cardiac muscle fibers. The fact that one fiber ends and another begins at the intercalated disk proves that cardiac muscle is not a syncytium (unbroken chain of fibers) as was once believed. Functionally, the disks not only hold the fibers together, but they constitute areas of low electrical resistance which permit the rapid spread of impulses from fiber to fiber and allow the muscle fibers to behave as though they were a syncytium.  H&E preparations do not show the disks as clearly as sections stained with iron hematoxylin or phosphotungstic acid hematoxylin.","thumb":"http://digitalmicro.mc.vanderbilt.edu/WebSlides/Pettepher/A-49/PreviewSlide.jpg","tissue":"Cardiac muscle","stain":"Trichrome"},

{"id":1734,"imageId":1712,"number":"A-51","description":"This is an H&E cross-section and longitudinal section of a peripheral nerve.  Peripheral nerves may contain any combination of afferent or efferent fibers of either the somatic or autonomic nervous system.  The morphological definition of a nerve is one or more bundles of nerve fibers enclosed by connective tissue sheaths.  The connective tissue (CT) in peripheral nerves is arranged similarly to the epi-, peri-, and endomysium seen in muscle cells.  Each individual nerve fiber (with its enveloping Schwann cell, discussed later) is surrounded by a loose CT called the endoneurium.  A large collection of nerve fibers is called a nerve fascicle, and this structure is invested by a dense, lamellated CT called the perineurium.  If the peripheral cell has more than one fascicle, the epineurium surrounds the fascicles and condenses peripherally to form a strong sheath.  Peripheral nerves are supplied by penetrating blood vessels that travel longitudinally within the epi and perineurium.  However, there are no vessels itimately associated with the endoneurium so transfer of gases and nutrients occurs via diffusion.  Can you identify the three connective tissue sheaths present in the nerve seen in this cross-section?  Blood vessels of various sizes can be identified within these layers as well.In the PNS, all axons are encased by Schwann cells, which are derived from the neuroectoderm and function in metabolic and structural support.  Small, unmyelinated axons are simply surrounded by the cytoplasm of Schwann cells.  However, axons with a larger diameter are wrapped in concentric layers of the Schwann cells' plasma membrane, which forms a myelin sheath.  These myelinated axons are capable of conducting action potentials at a higher velocity as the rate of conduction is directly related to the diameter of the axon.  In the CNS, Schwann cells do not myelinate axons; a different type of support cell called an oligodendrocyte (discussed in neuroanatomy) accomplishes the process of myelination here.  During the process of fixing and staining tissue, myelin is poorly preserved and unstained due to its high lipid content.  Therefore, large, myelinated fibers are seen (at high magnification) as an unstained ring around a nerve fiber.  Can you locate both myelinated and unmyelinated nerve fibers?  Remember that myelinated and unmyelinated axons are peripheral processes of cell bodies located in the CNS, spinal ganglia (like the dorsal root ganglion), and autonomic ganglia (soon to be discussed).  Do you see the nuclei of the Schwann cells among these nerve fibers?  The flattened nuclei of fibroblasts can also be seen in the perimysium of this section.In the longitudinal section of the nerve, identify both the Schwann cell nuclei that mark the course of individual nerve fibers and the slender, more condensed nuclei of fibroblast.  How can you tell the difference between this tissue and dense, regular connective tissue?","thumb":"http://digitalmicro.mc.vanderbilt.edu/WebSlides/Pettepher/A-51/PreviewSlide.jpg","tissue":"Peripheral nerve","stain":"H&E"},
{"id":1733,"imageId":1711,"number":"A-53","description":"This specimen is a blood smear that contains predominately Red Blood Cells or RBCs.  White Blood Cells or WBCs are found in fewer numbers and are scattered amongst the RBCs.  The RBCs are ~7-8 um in size are often used as a reference point in other specimens when determining the actual size of cells.  Frequently, cells may be identified more easily if their size is readily known.  The WBCs are larger and stain more intensely, especially the nuclei.  Mature RBCs are enucleate and should never stain basophilic.Examine the blood smear at highest magnification.  These smears are best observed under oil immersion so it may be difficult to see all the features clearly at lower magnifications. Keep in mind that all blood smears are likely to contain certain artifacts, such as smudges of disrupted cells and distorted leukocytes, and that it will not be possible to identify all leukocytes with certainty. Even if your slide is not optimally stained, remember as you carefully study the blood smear that nuclear morphology and granule size are useful criteria for identifying the different types of leukocytes. Note that in some areas the cells are spread far apart and that in other areas they may be piled on top of one another.  In the former areas, the white blood cells are flattened out and in the latter areas they are more nearly spherical and much smaller. The optimal area for observation is somewhere between these extremes and only in such an area will the cells correspond to textbook descriptions.  Try to identify segmented and non-segmented neutrophils.  The mature or segmented neutrophil is about twice the size of the red blood cell. The lobulated nucleus usually has three to five lobes connected by strands of chromatin. Lobes are sometimes superimposed, making it impossible to see the connecting strands of chromatin. In an ideal stain, the granules are pink to bluish-black.Nonsegmented (band or stab) are the youngest form of neutrophil that is commonly found in normal peripheral blood. The nucleus is horseshoe shaped and the indentation is greater than half the width of the hypothetically round nucleus. As in the segmented neutrophil, the granules are small and evenly distributed. They stain various shades of pink and blue.The eosinophil usually has a two-lobed nucleus. The granules are larger than those in the neutrophil and nearly fill the cell. They have an affinity for eosin and often stain reddish-orange.Basophils have large irregularly shaped, pale staining nuclei. The granules are of variable number and they may obscure the nucleus. Some of the granules are as large as or larger than those of eosinophils while others are intermediate in size between the granules of neutrophils and eosinophils. The granules are basophilic, metachromatic, and highly water-soluble. A pale area sometimes surrounds a granule.Lymphocytes may vary somewhat in size, but the majority of them will measure 7-8 μm (slightly larger than an erythrocyte). They have a relatively large, spherical nucleus, which may have a slight indentation on one side. With Wright's stain the nucleus has a solid or homogeneous appearance due to the densely packed, basophilic chromatin.  A relatively small amount of pale blue staining cytoplasm surrounds the nucleus.  A few azurophilic granules are seen occasionally in the cytoplasm, which are similar in appearance to those of granular leukocytes.Monocytes are the largest of the WBCs. The three most useful diagnostic features of these cells include their dull grey-blue cytoplasm, their larger size (12-15 μm), and their distinctive horseshoe or kidney shaped nucleus.  The nuclei are rarely spherical and their chromatin network is finer and stains less densely than that of the lymphocyte.Platelets or thrombocytes are fragments of megakaryocytes. Megakaryocytes are found in red bone marrow. Cytoplasmic processes of these cells protrude through the wall of a sinusoid in the bone marrow and break off to release the platelets into the blood stream. Platelets tend to adhere to one another and thus to occur in clumps.  An individual platelet varies in shape from round to ovoid and usually measures 1-4 μm in diameter. A centrally located granulomere (or chromomere) contains blue staining granules, while the more peripherally located, pale staining area is called the hyalomere.","thumb":"http://digitalmicro.mc.vanderbilt.edu/WebSlides/Pettepher/A-53/PreviewSlide.jpg","tissue":"Blood","stain":""},

During development, hematopoiesis occurs primarily in red bone marrow; however, it can also take place in the yolk sac, liver, and other organs.  In an adult, hematopoiesis only takes place in red bone marrow.

The epidermis of thin skin has far fewer cells in each of its layers (i.e., the total thickness of the stratum corneum, stratum granulosum, and stratum spinosum are greatly reduced in thickness).  Identify the melanocytes with dark nuclei and pale cytoplasm that can be seen interspersed between the keratinocytes in the stratum basale.  A few pigment containing macrophages can occasionally be seen in the dermis. These cells are phagocytic and do not produce pigment.  Note that the dermal papillae and rete pegs are less developed than in thick skin thus the waviness of the dermal-epidermal junction is not as pronounced.  The dermis is comparable to that of thick skin in that it has a thinner, more superficial papillary layer and a thicker, more deeply situated reticular layer.  Identify the small blood vessels of the subpapillary plexus.  They are located at the junction of the reticular layer and the papillary layer.  Vessels arising from this plexus can be seen as capillaries and arterioles in the dermal papillae.  The papillary blood vessels are in close association with the epidermal cells, which require nourishment for their growth and development.Identify the pigment containing cells in the epidermis and in the bulbs of hair follicles.  Begin to recognize either cross sections or longitudinal sections of hair follicles in the dermis and hypodermis. Study hair follicles in various stages of the hair growth cycle on scalp.   Keratinocytes that form these appendages grow downward from the surface during the 3-4 month of development.  The stem cell population resides in the bulge region where the erector pili muscle inserts into the hair shaft.  Periodically these cells grow downward (anagen growth phase), form an expanded hair bulb in the deep dermis or hypodermis and begin to undergo a special pattern of differentiation that will produce a highly keratinized structure known as hair.  The transiently amplifying hair matrix cells are found at the upper indentation of the hair bulb above of a tuft of capillaries, the dermal hair papilla that provide nourishment.  Melanocytes also populate the hair bulb region and provide coloration to the hair.  The cells lining the outer surface of the length of the hair follicle are known as outer root sheath cells and the multiple inner cell layers are known as inner root sheath cells. Identify sebaceous glands and arrector pili muscles in the dermis.  These structures will be located at a mid-dermal region in association with hair follicles.  Together they are called the pilosebaceous apparatus. Look for and examine the eccrine sweat glands.   Secretory portions of the glands lie deep in the dermis, at the dermal-hypodermal junction, or occasionally within the hypodermis.  A section through the secretory portion of a sweat gland will cut the coiled tubule into several cross sections.  It may appear that two layers of secretory cells line a tubule, but the outermost cells with somewhat elongated nuclei are the myoepithelial cells, which occupy a constant position between the basement membrane and the base of the secretory cells.  Myoepithelial cells have long contractile processes, which embrace the secretory cells and squeeze out the secretion.  The processes are not visible in H&E preparation, but they can be demonstrated by the alkaline phosphatase technique. Myoepithelial cells are also present in other glands, salivary glands, and mammary glands, and in each instance they occupy a similar position between the basement membrane and the base of the glandular epithelial cell.  In addition to basally located myoepithelial cells, pale cuboidal secretory cells can be seen surrounding the lumen of the secretory tubule.

Secretory portions of eccrine sweat glands can be seen deep in the reticular dermis and extending deeper into the upper hypodermis. In addition to the secretory portions of sweat glands, the hypodermis (subcutaneous connective tissue) contains lobules of adipose tissue, which are separated by strands of collagenous fibers.  When these septae become excessively filled with well-nourished adipocytes, the surface of the skin becomes dimpled and the appearance is known as cellulite.Eccrine sweat glands are located within the dermis of the skin.  The deeper portion of these simple coiled tubular glands is easily seen in the lower dermis; however, the long unbranched lumen that goes to the apical surface is rarely seen in cross-section.  However, you should llook for profiles of both.  The ductal components will stain similarly to the epithelium that is overlying the CT.  They should be lined with a simple to stratified cuboidal epithelium (characteristic of ducts) with centrally located nuclei.  The secretory units are lined by a simple cuboidal epithelium, and also contain centrally located nuclei .  They cytoplasm of the secretory units is paler staining and is one way to distinguish them from the ductal components of the gland.  Within this slide, find some myoepithelial cells. These smooth muscle cells, derived from ectoderm, reside between the basement membrane and the base of a secretory cell. These contractile cells are often elongated, spindle-shaped cells that are found within the basement membrane of the secretory units of the gland.  Upon contraction, myoepithelial cells assist in the expulsion of the secretory product from the cells.  This section also has abundant sebaceous glands.  Study keratinocytes found in th sebaceous glands and note the fine vacuoles of lipid/oil/sebum in all but the peripheral cells (those resting on the basement membrane).  The small cuboidal cells bordering the basement membrane undergo mitosis to replenish the more central ones which accumulate lipid and are lost as the glandular secretion.  As a cell accumulates fat droplets, it enlarges to become polyhedral or spherical in shape. The nucleus becomes pkynotic and the entire cell eventually disintegrates to enter the sebaceous gland duct as sebum.  This method of secretion is call holocrine secretion.  The sebaceous gland is a branched, alveolar gland.Look for the smooth muscle associated with the hair follicles of the scalp.  These smooth muscle fibers are often found arising from the basal aspects of the hair follicle and ascending toward the apical surface of the skin.  These smooth muscle fibers, called the arrector pili muscle, often travel laterally to the sebaceous glands associated with the hair follicle.  These arrector pili muscles are important in the body temperature homeostasis regulated by the autonomic nervous system.  Smooth muscle fibers are spindle shaped and range from less than 1 μm in diameter at their ends to as much as 8 μm in diameter at their centers. They vary in length, depending upon the organ in which they are found. There is one nucleus in each fiber. It is elongated (ovoid) and centrally located in the widest portion of the fiber.  The nucleus contains one or more small nucleoli.  A small rim of chromatin is often condensed against the nuclear envelope, and small specks of chromatin are distributed in the nucleoplasm.  Nuclei of fibers fixed in the contracted state appear wrinkled or corkscrew-shaped.  The cytoplasm usually appears acidophilic and homogeneous after routine fixation and staining (H&E).","thumb":"http://digitalmicro.mc.vanderbilt.edu/WebSlides/Pettepher/A-96/PreviewSlide.jpg","tissue":"Human scalp","stain":"H&E"},

Under low power, find the epidermis of the section on the right. With high power, study the granules of melanin pigment that are present in the epidermal cells and note that the pigment is most abundant in the keratinocytes located near the dermis. Pigment decreases in the keratinocytes as the stratum corneum is approached. The stratum corneum is the layer of dead cells at the free surface of the skin. Melanin, the pigment largely responsible for skin color, is produced by melanocytes, which number about the same in all races but differ in the amount of melanin they produce. Melanin is transferred via long cytoplasmic processes of melanocytes to the intercellular spaces where it is taken up by keratinocytes and placed in a supranuclear position melanosomes.  Cell bodies and cytoplasmic processes of melanocytes are not clearly shown by conventional stains, but they can be demonstrated by treatment of sections with dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA).  The DOPA reaction demonstrates that the cell bodies of most melanocytes are located in the stratum basale while their cytoplasmic processes (some times called dendritic processes) extend between cells of the stratum spinosum.

The collagen protein in the fibers that abundantly comprise this layer have an attraction for or interact with acidic or anionic dyes and therefore stain vivid pink.   The collagen fibers exhibit \"acidophilia\" or are characterized as \"acidophilic\" in nature.  The collagen fibers in the dermis are pink and wavy and they vary from 1-6 μm in width. Since the dermis is irregular connective tissue, the fibers are cut transversely, obliquely, and longitudinally. The fibers may shrink somewhat during tissue processing and the seemingly empty spaces between them, which in life contain tissue fluid or ground substance, may appear larger than in the living state. Note that elastic and reticular fibers ar also present in the dermis of the skin.  They are not as readily visualized because they are smaller than the collagen fibers.  Often special stains are utililzed to visual them.  See if the transition areas between dense and loose CT can be identified.

Myoepithelial cells are absent in the ductIdentify the apocrine glands and compare with the eccrine glands in the same section.  Secretory portions of apocrine glands are much larger than secretory portions of eccrine glands and their lumina measure as much as 200 μm in diameter. This is ten times the average diameter of lumina of eccrine sweat glands.  Apices of some cells of apocrine glands are rounded and can be seen breaking off to enter the lumina as part of the secretion.  This mode of secretion where part of the cell is lost is termed apocrine secretion. Myoepithelial cells are present in secretory portions of apocrine glands, and appear even more prominent than in eccrine glands.  The intradermal ducts of apocrine glands have the same histological appearance as corresponding ducts of eccrine glands.  They are devoid of myoepithelium and have a double layer of dark staining epithelial cells, which have a periluminal cuticle.  The latter becomes especially prominent as the duct traverses the papillary layer of the dermis.  Most ducts of apocrine glands open into hair follicles, but some open directly onto the surface, as do all eccrine ducts.  Quite commonly, more than one apocrine duct empties into the same hair follicle, usually entering the follicle slightly above the opening of the sebaceous duct.

{"id":1697,"imageId":1675,"number":"A-99","description":"This is an H&E section of thick skin.  Study and identify the layers of the epidermis: stratum basale, stratum spinosum, stratum granulosum, and stratum corneum.  The predominant cell type, an epidermal keratinocyte, begins its life cycle in the basal layer and becomes progressively more differentiated as it moves toward the surface - a process that produces a stratified squamous keratinizing epithelium.  Observe the flattened, dead surface cells (sometimes called corneocytes or dandruff in the scalp) of the thick stratum corneum.  A few of the surface cells are being desquamated. Some areas of the stratum corneum show spiraling sweat ducts, each of which will end in a sweat pore at the surface.  Nuclei and other cellular organelles are absent in the stratum corneum.  The stratum granulosum is composed of increasingly flattened rectangular-shaped cells filled with keratohyalin granules.  The large accumulation of basophilic granules in these cells is composed of filaggrin and keratin filaments.  The thickness of this layer varies from one to three cells and as a rule is representative of the rate of keratinization.  Thus, there are little or no stratum granulosum or keratohyalin granules in diseases, with a rapid rate of keratinization such as psoriasis, whereas the granular layer is thickened in diseases with a slow rate of keratinization. The stratum spinosum is composed of several layers of polyhedral cells, which flatten as the stratum granulosum is approached.  The cytoplasm is rich in tonofibrils, which are specific for keratin pairs 1 and 10.  Individual cells appear to be separated by spaces that are traversed by the so-called intercellular bridges which can be seen as fine lines between adjacent cells at higher magnifications.  They account for the prickly appearance of the cells and for their frequent designation as prickle cells.  These are tissue preparation artifacts caused when water is removed during the dehydration step.   Spinous cells are attached to their neighbors by a multitude of desmosomal attachments and these connections remain as the fragile cytoplasm shrinks.  The stratum basalis is composed of a single layer of cuboidal to columnar cells, which are attached to the basement membrane by hemidesmosomes.  These cells express keratin intermediate filament pairs 5 and 14.  This layer contains the stem cell population and an occasional mitotic figure of a transient amplifying cell may be observed.  A few melanocytes (1 for every 36 keratinocytes) can be identified by their pale (empty) cytoplasm and dark nuclei among the keratinocytes of the stratum basalis.  These cells do not contain tough keratin filaments and also shrink during tissue preparation.A basement membrane exists between the epidermis and dermis.  Reticular fibers are present in the basement membrane and account for the prominence of this structure after PAS staining.  Note that the border between the epidermis and dermis known as the dermal-epidermal junction is irregular because numerous upward interdigitations known as dermal papillae indent the undersurface of the epidermis.  Papillae are far more prominent in thick skin than in thin skin since they serve to help these surfaces resist shear forces and friction.  Rete pegs are corresponding elongated downward projecting ridges of epidermis.  Some rete pegs are narrower than others are and they are the ones, which receive the sweat ducts.  Under oil immersion, note that the basal cells of the larger pegs have very fine processes, which anchor the cells to the basement membrane.  Basal cells of the narrow ridges are smoother, allowing them to shift more easily.Look at the dense irregular connective tissue known as the dermis. Note that it is somewhat subdivided into an upper thin papillary layer and a thicker, deeply position reticular layer. The papillary dermis will stain lighter because the collagen fibrils are not as large or as extensively cross-linked or packed. This facilitates diffusion of molecules that nourish the overlying a vascular epidermis. Numerous capillaries are present in the papillae of the papillary layer. Meissner's corpuscles (encapsulated sensory nerve endings for touch that resemble sectioned pinecones) can be seen in some papillae.  The reticular layer of the dermis is so named because of the woven arrangement of the heavily cross-linked collagenous fibers (in the form of a close meshed net) and not because of the presence of reticular fibers. Note the pink wavy collagenous fibers in the dermis, which vary from 1-6 μm in width. Since the dermis is irregular connective tissue, the fibers are cut transversely, obliquely, and longitudinally. The fibers may shrink somewhat during tissue processing and the seemingly empty spaces between them, which in life contain tissue fluid or ground substance, may appear larger than in the living state.  Deep to the dense irregular bands of collagen in the dermis are aggregations of fat cells -- adipocytes -- in the hypodermis.Examine eccrine sweat glands..

The wall, like that of bronchioles, is composed mainly of smooth muscle.They arise from the final bifurcations of bronchioles.  They have a diameter of 0.5 mm or less and are called \"terminal\" because they are the final link in the air conducting passage before respiratory tissue is reached.  Since bronchioles and terminal bronchioles lack cartilage (and bronchial glands), they are sometimes referred to as membranous airways to distinguish them from the cartilaginous airways (trachea and bronchi) and from the gas exchange airways (respiratory bronchioles and alveolar ducts).  Structurally, terminal bronchioles resemble bronchioles except for the following:1. The diameter is smaller than that of a bronchiole.2. The epithelium varies from ciliated simple columnar to ciliated simple cuboidal. The cilia, however, are sometimes lost during tissue processing.3. Goblet cells are absent.4. The mucosa is less folded and the lamina propria is even thinner than that of bronchioles.Look for respiratory bronchioles.  They are the first structures, which belong to the respiratory portion of the lung.  They are called \"respiratory\" because they actually participate in the respiratory process by having several, small, sac-like outpocketings called alveoli which usually arise from only one side of their wall.  Respiratory bronchioles are difficult to identify at first but with practice they become easier to locate.The serous membrane lining the thoracic wall is called parietal pleura.  At the hilus of each lung, the parietal pleura is reflected over the lung and becomes the visceral pleura. The potential space between the two serous membranes is called the pleural cavity and contains a thin film of fluid, which permits the two layers of pleura to slide easily against each other during respiration.The free surface of the pleura (parietal and visceral) is lined with mesothelium. Fibroblasts, macrophages, and many capillaries and lymphatics are present between the connective tissue fibers.

It may not appear as a complete layer because it is composed of two sets of smooth muscle fibers, which extend down the bronchial tree in a right and left spiral.  The submucosa is a layer of loose connective tissue, which lies outside the muscularis.  Bronchial glands are present in this layer and also extend into the intercartilaginous intervals.  If possible, find a duct that is passing through the lamina propria to open onto the epithelial surface.  The cartilage-fibrous layer lies outside the submucosa.  It contains discontinuous plates of hyaline cartilage and fibrous connective tissue.  The peribronchial layer is the thin outermost layer of connective tissue.  It contains many elastic fibers and separates the wall of the bronchus from the pulmonary parenchyma.  The peribronchial layer permits bronchi to move independent of other lung parenchyma.  Note the relationship of the intrapulmonary bronchi to the pulmonary and bronchial vasculature.Observe some of the smaller bronchi on the same slide.  Note that the amount of cartilage decreases and that the amount of smooth muscle increases as the bronchi become smaller.  Due to the scarcity of cartilage and to the contraction of the muscle, the bronchial mucosa of smaller bronchi is folded.  After a number of divisions, the cartilage disappears, the smooth muscle reaches its full development, and an air tube becomes known as a bronchiole.Bronchioles lack cartilage and glands and generally have a diameter less than 1 mm.  They are comparable to intralobular ducts of glands.  One bronchiole serves a unit of the lung called a lobule.  Three layers can be distinguished: mucosa, muscularis, and an outer layer.  The mucosa is highly folded, due to the absence of cartilage and to contraction of the smooth muscle, and is usually lined by ciliated pseudostratified columnar (low) epithelium.  Goblet cells are rare. The lamina propria is thin but rich in elastic fibers.  The muscularis is the thickest layer.  It has thick bands of smooth muscle, which completely encircle the bronchiole.  The outer layer is thin.  As in the remainder of the airways, the connective tissue of this layer is continuous with the parenchyma of the lung so that these passages move with the lungs. The serous membrane lining the thoracic wall is called parietal pleura.  At the hilus of each lung, the parietal pleura is reflected over the lung and becomes the visceral pleura. The potential space between the two serous membranes is called the pleural cavity and contains a thin film of fluid, which permits the two layers of pleura to slide easily against each other during respiration.The free surface of the pleura (parietal and visceral) is lined with mesothelium. Fibroblasts, macrophages, and many capillaries and lymphatics are present between the connective tissue fibers. The parietal pleura contains sensory nerve fibers (from the phrenic and intercostal nerves) and is very sensitive to pain.  Visceral pleura contains nerve fibers of vagal and sympathetic origin and is insensitive to pain.  Look for the visceral pleura.","thumb":"http://digitalmicro.mc.vanderbilt.edu/WebSlides/Pettepher/B-15/PreviewSlide.jpg","tissue":"Lung","stain":"Hematoxylin and trisosine"},

The plastic samples are sliced more thinly, allowing for a more detailed study of the cells and tissues comprising the organ.  A respiratory bronchiole gives rise to several alveolar ducts, each characterized in sections by having many alveoli, which arise from both sides of its wall.  note their histological features.1. Epithelium. The vast majority of cells are simple squamous but a few are simple cuboidal (low).2. Lamina propria. This is composed of a network of fine elastic fibers, reticular fibers, and a few collagenous fibers.  Smooth muscle is present only around the openings (mouths) of alveoli.  Consequently, the lamina propria is thickened into little knobs at points where alveoli arise.  The presence of these knobs helps to distinguish an alveolar duct from an alveolar sac. 3. Atria.  Each of these is nothing more than a vestibule, which connects an alveolar duct with an alveolar sac.  They are sometimes considered as part of alveolar ducts.4. Alveolar sacs.  Each is a collection or cluster of alveoli.  Alveoli of sacs do not have knob-like thickenings.5.Alveoli.  Each alveolus is a cup-shaped, polyhedral thin-walled sac, which lacks one wall and opens into a respiratory bronchiole, an alveolar duct, or an alveolar sac.  There are about 300 million alveoli per lung.  Each has a diameter of about 250 um.a. Alveolar wall (interalveolar septum).  Note the thin wall of the alveolus, a feature which favors the interchange of gas between blood and air.  b. Small alveolar cells (Type I cells or respiratory alveolar cells) are squamous cells. Nuclei are darkly stained, flattened, and usually far apart.  Cytoplasmic processes extending from these cells are very thin.  They appear with the light microscope as fine lines extending along the surface of the alveolar lumen.c. Great alveolar cells (Type II cells) are cuboidal to round cells, which occupy grooves in the alveolar wall or bulge into the alveolar lumen.  With the light microscope, their cytoplasm is pale or lightly basophilic and usually vacuolated.  The electron microscope shows that these cells are secretory cells (have an extensive Golgi apparatus, granular endoplasmic reticulum, etc.).  They contain small membrane-bound bodies (0.2-1.0 pm in diameter) called cytosomes or lamellar bodies, which correspond to the cytoplasmic vacuoles seen with the light microscope.  Cytosomes contain surfactant, a phospholipid wetting agent, which upon release from the cell spreads along the alveolar epithelium thereby reducing surface tension and preventing collapse of the alveoli.  Some infants do not secrete adequate quantities of surfactant and die of respiratory distress during the first few days of life.  This condition is called hyaline membrane disease.","thumb":"http://digitalmicro.mc.vanderbilt.edu/WebSlides/Pettepher/B-17/PreviewSlide.jpg","tissue":"Respiratory bronchiole","stain":""},

Locate and identify the following areas and structures:The core or central portion contains fibroelastic connective tissue and skeletal muscle fibers of the orbicularis oris.The outer surface is covered by typical thin skin with hairs, sebaceous glands, and eccrine sweat glands.  It is also called the cutaneous surface.The free surface (red area, vermillion border, transitional area) is interposed between the skin of the outer surface and the mucous membrane of the inner surface. It is lined by stratified squamous epithelium, which has a superficial layer of dead but non-cornified cells. The epithelium is indented by numerous connective tissue papillae that are very high and vascular.  Many nerve endings are present in the papillae.  For this reason the lips are very sensitive.  Blood, in the capillaries, shows through the epithelium to produce the red color.  The papillae cause the free surface to gap when cut, making it difficult for the free surface to heal without scarring.  Hairs and sweat glands are absent at the free surface, but an occasional sebaceous gland may, be present whose duct opens directly onto the surface.  Since the epithelium is non-keratinized and has little or no sebum, the free surface must be wetted frequently with the tongue to prevent drying and cracking.The inner surface or mucous membrane of the lip is covered by a thick, non-cornified stratified squamous epithelium, which is indented by low connective tissue papillae.  A lamina propria of rather compact fibroelastic connective tissue lies below the epithelium and it is not sharply demarcated from the submucosa.  The submucosa binds the mucous membrane to the underlying skeletal muscle so that the mucosa is free of folds and is not bitten during mastication.

The stroma (supportive connective tissue) divides the parotid, as well as the other salivary glands, into lobes and lobules.  A lobe is surrounded by a thick septum of connective tissue; lobules, the units of a lobe, are demarcated by thin connective tissue septa.  Besides its supportive role, the stroma provides an avenue for the passage of autonomic nerve fibers, blood and lymph vessels, and excretory ducts (interlobular and interlobar).  The stroma also extends into the lobules to surround the various parenchymal components.  Fat is usually abundant in the stroma of the parotid gland.Study the parenchyma (functional tissue) of the parotid, noting the acini, intercalated ducts, striated or intralobular ducts, and excretory ducts (interlobular and interlobar).  The parotid gland is classified as a compound alveolar gland whose secretory units synthesize and secrete proteinaceous (serous) material.  Look for the secretory acini.  Note the elongated grape-like collection of pyramidal cells whose apices are directed toward a common, small lumen.  Their basal plasma membranes rest on a thin basement membrane.  Look for the secretory granules in the apical cytoplasm and the presence of rER in the basal cytoplasm (basophilic staining).  Compound serous secreting glands have an extensive ductal system.  The lumina of all acini empty directly into intercalate ducts.  These ducts are lined by a single layer of cells,which are cuboidal in shape but become flattened at their junctions with acini.  These ducts empty into larger striated ducts that are located within the lobule (intralobular) and extend to the periphery of the lobule where they will connect with interlobular (excretory) ducts in the surrounding CT.  Striated ducts are lined by a single layer of cuboidal to columnar cells and contain a centrally located, round to ovoid nucleus.  Vertical striations present below the nucleus are due to infoldings of the basal plasma membrane and long mitochondria lie between and parallel to the infoldings.

{"id":1676,"imageId":1654,"number":"B-38","description":"This specimen was taken from the upper one-third of the esophagus and it shows a great variety of cell and tissue types.  At its luminal surface there is a multi-layered lining of epithelial cells (termed mucosa).  Note that the cells in the apical (luminal) layer have different staining characteristics than the cells found in the deeper layers.  The components of the mucosal layer include the epithleium, lamina propria and the muscularis mucosae.  The lamina propria is a loose, irregular CT that is rich in lymphocytes, plasma cells and small blood vessels.  Most of the smooth muscle of the muscularis mucosae is arranged as longitudinal bundles with individual bundles separated by loose CT.  A dense connective tissue or submucosal layer is found beneath the mucosa and it contains a plexus of blood vessels, nerves and glands (submucosal glands or esophageal glands proper).  Identify the pale, secretory cells of the glands and the larger ducts that extend to the lumen and are lined by a stratified columnar epithelium.  The glands secrete mucus, which aids in the passage of food.    Peripheral to the CT layer is a muscular layer that contains densely packed skeletal muscle comprised of actin and myosin filaments. There are 2 layers of muscle, an inner circular layer and an outer longitudinal layer.  The muscle in this layer will convert to smooth muscle as it reaches the lower-third close to the junction with the stomach.  The middle-third has both smooth and skeletal muscle.  Find the connective tissue lamina, which separates the inner circular and outer longitudinal layers and locate one or more neurons of the myenteric plexus of Auerbach.  Look for small arteries and veins in the adventitial (peripheral) and submucosal (CT under the epithelium) layers.  These  are unnamed blood vessels. The arteries possess three tunics, which vary in thickness, but there must be at least two layers of smooth muscle for it to be classified as a small artery. Intimal, medial and adventitial layers are present in veins but they are not as clearly demarcated as in arteries.  The veins contain an elastic net and some smooth muscle fibers separated by connective tissue. In comparison to arteries, veins have a larger lumen and a relatively thinner wall.  Therefore, they appear collapsed in histologic sections.Also look for arterioles which are the smallest part of the arterial tree.  These vessels regulate the flow of blood into capillaries, which in turn, drain into venules, the first component of the venous system.  Histologically, the intima of an arteriole is composed of endothelial cells lying on a basement membrane.  The media layer of an arteriole has either scattered smooth muscle fibers or a single complete layer of smooth muscle around the endothelial tube. The elastic tissue forms an elastic net rather than an internal elastic membrane. Reticular fibers and collagenous fibers surround individual smooth muscle fibers and condense externally to form the tunica adventitia. The diameter of an arteriole ranges from capillary size to around 20 um, depending largely on the degree of vasoconstriction. The arteriole is sometimes called a metarteriole (smallest arterioles or pre-capillary arteriole).   Arterioles can be distinguished from small arteries by the number of smooth muscle layers in the tunica media layer and the tunica intima of a small artery has an internal elastic membrane.  Capillaries drain into postcapillary venules, which are the smallest venules (~10 - 25m in diameter).  They resemble capillaries in structure, but contain more pericytes.  Postcapillary venules drain into large collecting venules (~20-50m in diameter).  Here the pericyte layer becomes more continuous and is surrounded by collagen fibers.  As the venules increase in diameter, smooth muscle cells replace the pericytes and form a layer that is 1 to 2 cells in thickness.  Use the slides listed above to identify venules, the smallest of the veins. Note that one or two venules may accompany each arteriole. The lumen is usually larger and the wall is thinner in the venule than in the arteriole.

Identify the surface mucous cells and under high magnification note that they are all alike.  Most of them contain an apical pocket-shaped area (theca) that is filled with mucus.  The mucus is pale with H&E or Trichrome but very dark with PAS.  The mucus does not cause the nucleus to be flattened as in goblet cells.  Surface mucous cells also line the gastric pits.  Study the gastric glands, which are long, relatively straight, simple tubular glands with narrow lumina.  They extend through the lamina propria and down to the muscularis mucosae.  Parietal cells, because of their large size and acidophilic cytoplasm, constitute the most conspicuous cell type in the gastric glands.  They are round cells with round nuclei; some are binucleated.  The granular appearance of the cytoplasm is due to the large number of mitochondria present in these cells.  Parietal cells are concerned with HCl production, a process, which involves a number of intermediate steps, which protect the cells of origin from self-destruction.  Note the presence of intracellular canaliculi in the parietal cells. These are important structures in the mechanism of HCl production.  They are large, pale areas.  The acid is not present in the cell cytoplasm, but it is present in the canaliculi.  Besides their role in HCl production, the parietal cells of man produce a glandular mucoprotein, the intrinsic factor of Castle.

Secretory granules and intracellular canaliculi can also be seen.  Find an area where a gastric pit can be traced downward from the surface and note that the amount of mucus diminishes toward the bottom of the pit.  Locate the mucous neck cells, if possible, which can sometimes be observed, intermingled with, parietal cells at the neck of the gastric gland.  Histochemical staining with alcain blue shows that the mucus in the mucous neck cells is an acid mucosubstance.  It differs from the mucus in the mucous surface cells, which is a neutral mucosubstance.  Both types of mucus protect the stomach from being digested by its own secretions.  Observe the chief cells especially those in the fundic portion of the glands.  The basal region of the chief cells stains rather heavily with hematoxylin because of the large amount of basally located rER.  The apical part of the cell has fine vacuoles, which represent secretory granules whose contents have been partially dissolved.The argentaffin cells of the enteroendocrine system represent another cell type found in gastric glands, but are present in other locations as well.  They are said to be particularly prominent in the pyloric stomach and the duodenum of the small intestine.  They are difficult to identify with routine staining procedures.  In the stomach they are located at the base of the glands, intermixed with the other cell types.  Ultrastructurally they resemble peptide hormone secreting cells.  They contain a well-developed granular endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus, with the secretory granules located between the nucleus and the basement membrane.  These cells secrete a number of hormones, including gastrin, enteroglucagon, serotonin and histamine.  Because such endocrine cells are scattered throughout several organ systems, they are included in a larger category of cells known collectively as the \"diffuse neuroendocrine system.\"Notice the muscular layer, which is located towards the top of the slide opposite the lining epithelium, a simple columnar epithelium, of the stomach being located at the bottom of the slide  The muscular layer of the fundic stomach is very thick, which aids in physically breaking down food and moving the churned food toward the pylorus.  This smooth muscle layer is also composed of an external longitudinal and an internal circular smooth muscle layer, but there is an additional layer called the oblique smooth muscle layer as well.  Study the smooth muscle in the walls of the veins and arteries found in the stomach.","thumb":"http://digitalmicro.mc.vanderbilt.edu/WebSlides/Pettepher/B-46/PreviewSlide.jpg","tissue":"Fundic stomach","stain":""},

Near the periphery of the muscularis between the outer longitudinal and middle circular layers of smooth muscle, find a group of neurons of the myenteric plexus of Auerbach.Autonomic ganglia (of the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous system) are very similar to the somatic sensory ganglia, with a few subtle variations.  These distinguishing factors include: (1) exhibiting eccentrically-located nuclei within the cell bodies, (2) having more space in between each cell body (due to the multi-polar nature of the neurons and the synapses present), (3) possessing a less distinct capsule surround each cell body with fewer satellite cells, and (4) displaying an occasional binucleated ganglion cell.  Brown-stained lipofuscin granules are also located with the cytoplasm of the cell bodies of autonomic ganglion, and sympathetic ganglia often have more lipofuscin granules than most sensory ganglia.  Remember, the neurons are pseudo-unipolar in spinal ganglia versus the multi-polar neurons present in autonomic ganglia; however, this difference is difficult to detect in a single, thin section without the use of special stains.  The nerve fibers, scattered between the cell bodies of autonomic ganglia, also possess little to no myelin, unlike the large myelinated fibers seen in spinal ganglia.Neurons of these parasympathetic ganglia generally have large, pale-staining nuclei with prominent nucleoli.  The cytoplasm is not always visible, but it may stain basophilic in H&E sections.

Find the villi (luminal side) and study the appearance of the simple columnar epithelial cells, goblet cells and prominent brush border found on the apical surface of the cells.  What can be concluded about the chemical nature of the goblet cells and the striated border based on their appearance in this section?Begin the study of the duodenum by examining the section at the lowest magnification (Fit) noting the plicae circulares (valves of Kerckring), which extend into the lumen of the duodenum.  Identify the villi, which project from the plicae.  Study the surface epithelium, which consists of columnar absorptive cells.  In addition to absorptive cells, goblet cells, which are absent in the stomach, also characterize the duodenal epithelium.  Try to identify the goblet cells on your section.  The submucosa lies beneath the muscularis mucosae and contains the glands of Brunner (submucosal glands or duodenal glands).  These coiled tubular, mucous glands are of the compound tubular type and are found in the submucosa of all but the distal or inferior portion of the duodenum.  They resemble pyloric glands but are much larger.  The tubules of mucous secretory cells are usually cut transversely or obliquely.  Ducts pass through the muscularis mucosae and usually open into the crypts of Lieberkuhn, but occasionally they open between the villi.  The mucous secretion of the glands of Brunner is clear, viscous, and alkaline (pH 8.2-9.3).  Its principal function, by reason of its mucoid nature, its alkalinity, and possibly by the buffering capacity of its bicarbonate content, is thought to be to protect the duodenal mucosa from the acidity of gastric fluid.  Mitotic figures are quite evident in this section.  Paneth cells are not well stained.Locate the muscularis of the duodenum and note that the inner circular layer is somewhat thicker than the outer longitudinal layer.  The serosa is the thin outermost tunic of loose connective tissue.

Note that glands are absent in the submucosa.  Since intestinal villi undergo rapid postmortem changes and seldom show characteristic features in sections, other characteristics must be taken into consideration in order to distinguish the three segments of the small intestine.  Thus, on practical examinations, any section of the small intestine containing Brunner's glands is to be considered duodenum, any section with aggregated lymph nodules as ileum and, if both are lacking, as jejunum.  Between the inner and outer longitudinal layers of the muscularis, identify neurons of the myenteric plexus of Auerbach.  Study the long villi and note under high magnification the columnar absorptive cells with striated borders.  The border appears as a pale, refractile line after H&E staining and may not be visible in all areas of the section.

Although the muscle and submucosa are not well preserved, the epithelium is and nicely illustrates goblet and Paneth cells.  The former contain a basophilic mucus while the latter are found in the fundic portions (bottom) of the crypts and contain acidophilic granules.  The lamina propria has few readily identifiable cells except for a large number of eosinophils.  Neurons of the myenteric plexus of Auerbach are numerous while only a few nerve profiles of the submucosal plexus of Meissner can be seen.  These represent terminal parasympathetic neurons of the autonomic nervous system, and can be seen between the inner and outer longitudinal layers of the muscularis.  Pre-ganglionic fibers from the vagus nerve synapse with these neurons.  Post-ganglionic fibers arise from the neurons and terminate, for the most part, on muscle cells (of the muscularis externa and muscularis mucosae), which they stimulate.  Impulses carried by the postganglionic parasympathetic fibers tend to augment both the tone and the peristaltic movements of the muscle.  Sympathetic fibers do not synapse with neurons between the muscle layers before terminating on the smooth muscle cells.  They carry impulses, which tend to inhibit both the tone and peristaltic movements of the muscle.  In addition to neurons of the myenteric plexus, locate the neurons of the submucosal plexus of Meissner in the submucosal connective tissue.  These neurons are far fewer than neurons of the myenteric plexus and they may be difficult to find.  Pre-ganglionic fibers from the vagus nerve also synapse with neurons of the submucosal plexus. Post-ganglionic fibers arising from neurons in Meissner's plexus innervate the mucosal glands of the digestive tube.  The plexuses of Auerbach and Meissner extend the whole length of the digestive tube, i.e., from the upper portion of the esophagus to the internal sphincter of the anus.  Besides neurons, they contain complicated intermixtures of sympathetic and parasympathetic fibers, which are indistinguishable morphologically.  The alimentary parasympathetic innervation of the vagus extends to the descending colon.  The sacral parasympathetics from S-2, S-3 and S-4 cord segments innervate the remainder of the digestive tube, including the descending colon, sigmoid colon, and rectum.  The preganglionic sympathetic fibers for the digestive tract arise from T-5 (or T-6) to L-2 (or L-3) cord segments and synapse in the vertebral and prevertebral ganglia.

Numerous isolated nodules and aggregates of nodules (Peyer's patches) can be found in the ileum.  All of these nodules are reactive and become enlarged during encounters with antigen.  Look immediately under the glandular epithelium and observe the numerous lymphocytes in the lamina propria.A single patch occupies much of the circumference of this cross-sectioned ileum, which is opened on the side where the mesentery would attach.     They occupy both the lamina propria of the mucosa and submucosa and occur on the side of the ileum opposite the attachment of the mesentery.  Villi are either absent or reduced in height above the patches.  The patches are sometimes called intestinal tonsils, and like the tonsils, they atrophy with age.  Note also the numerous macrophages (greenish pigment in the cytoplasm) present within the lymphoid aggregates.Most features of the rabbit intestine are similar to humans, but the muscularis may be thinner here.  Study in detail the features of the epithelium, which covers the villi and lines the intestinal glands.  The features are similar to those of epithelium elsewhere in the small intestine.  In the ileum, however, goblet cells are more numerous and the striated border of the columnar absorptive cells is less promi¬nent than in the duodenum or jejunum.  Find a suitable area where the epithelium can be traced from the tip of a villus into the intestinal glands.  Note that within the gland the columnar cells are lower and the striated border seems to disappear. This indicates that the columnar cells of the glands are less differentiated and correlates with results from labeling experiments \"which show that the cells of the glands are active mitotically”. They multiply and differentiate as they move up the sides of the glands to reach the villi.  They eventually reach the tips of the villi where they are sloughed off into the intestinal lumen at the end of their relatively short life cycle.  Goblet cells also arise from undifferentiated cells of the glands.Paneth cells lie in the fundic portions of the glands. They are pale and vacuolated in this section due to the dissolution of their secretory granules.  Argentaffin cells, characterized by infranuclear secretory granules, are scattered among the epithelial cells of the glands and villi of the small intestine (fairly common in the duodenum but sparse in the jejunum and ileum).Study cross sections of villi and be able to distinguish them from cross sections of intestinal glands.  Note that the lamina propria, forming the core of the villus, is separated from the epithelium by a thin basement membrane.  Note the rich vascularity of the villi and attempt to find the thin-walled central lacteals, the lymphatic vessels, which drain chyle from villi of the intestine.

{"id":1659,"imageId":1637,"number":"B-59","description":"This specimen was taken from the ileum of a monkey, embedded in plastic and stained with H&E.  “Mitotic figures” typical of tissue sections can be seen in the intestinal crypts (base of the finger-like projections or villi).  Some, but not all, of the mitotic stages can be found.  Find the epithelium lining the rounded villous projections of the ileum. With high magnification, note the cells, which have large pale unstained areas within their cytoplasm that appear to open into the lumen.  These are goblet cells.  Study the prominent pale pink, striated border at the free surface. The striated border is found throughout the small intestine (as well as several other locations) and is referred to as striated because it appears to have vertical striations under oil immersion of the light microscope. Electron micrographs show that the border is formed by cytoplasmic extensions called microvilli. Microvilli of the small intestine are regularly arranged and consistent in height (about 2μm), which resembles the bristles on a brush, hence their collective other name, brush border. They greatly increase the surface area of the cells and function in absorption. Certain enzymes, which facilitate absorption, are present in the microvilli. Electron micrographs show that a surface coat (glycocalyx or fuzzy coat) is present on the microvilli. The surface coat contains carbohydrates, which stains vividly pink when using PAS as the stain.  Look for the presence of terminal bars (dark red lines) on the apical-lateral plasma membrane.  Their visualization reflects the presence of cell junctions.  Look for small arteries and veins in the adventitial (peripheral) and the submucosal (CT under the epithelium) layers.  These  are unnamed blood vessels. The arteries possess three tunics, which vary in thickness, but there must be at least two layers of smooth muscle for it to be classified as a small artery. Intimal, medial and adventitial layers are present in veins but they are not as clearly demarcated as in arteries.  The veins contain an elastic net and some smooth muscle fibers separated by connective tissue. In comparison to arteries, veins have a larger lumen and a relatively thinner wall.  Therefore, they appear collapsed in histologic sections.Also look for arterioles which are the smallest part of the arterial tree.  These vessels regulate the flow of blood into capillaries, which in turn, drain into venules, the first component of the venous system.  Histologically, the intima of an arteriole is composed of endothelial cells lying on a basement membrane.  The media layer of an arteriole has either scattered smooth muscle fibers or a single complete layer of smooth muscle around the endothelial tube. The elastic tissue forms an elastic net rather than an internal elastic membrane. Reticular fibers and collagenous fibers surround individual smooth muscle fibers and condense externally to form the tunica adventitia. The diameter of an arteriole ranges from capillary size to around 20 um, depending largely on the degree of vasoconstriction. The arteriole is sometimes called a metarteriole (smallest arterioles or pre-capillary arteriole).   Arterioles can be distinguished from small arteries by the number of smooth muscle layers in the tunica media layer and the tunica intima of a small artery has an internal elastic membrane.  Capillaries drain into postcapillary venules, which are the smallest venules (~10 - 25um in diameter).  They resemble capillaries in structure, but contain more pericytes.  Postcapillary venules drain into large collecting venules (~20-50um in diameter).  Here the pericyte layer becomes more continuous and is surrounded by collagen fibers.  As the venules increase in diameter, smooth muscle cells replace the pericytes and form a layer that is 1 to 2 cells in thickness.  Use the slides listed above to identify venules, the smallest of the veins. Note that one or two venules may accompany each arteriole. The lumen is usually larger and the wall is thinner in the venule than in the arteriole. The wall of the venule lacks distinct layers and is so thin that it resembles a capillary wall.Excellent section for the study of the cytoarchitecture of the ileum.

This tissue was prepared by injecting into the renal artery a warm mixture of gelatin stained with carmine, thus filling the vascular bed.  Study the vasculature distribution. The large arcuate arteries at the corticomedullary junction can be seen.  Arcuate arteries, like the interlobar arteries, are end arteries in that they do not anastomose with each other.Interlobular arteries arise from arcuate arteries. They lie within the pars convoluta of the cortex, about midway between two adjacent medullary rays. The area between two interlobular arteries is a kidney lobule.  It includes a medullary ray (pars radiata) and half of each adjoining pars convoluta.  All the nephrons of a lobule drain into a common collecting tubule.  Each interlobular artery gives off a number of afferent glomerular arterioles before it ends in a capillary bed beneath the capsule.Each afferent glomerular arteriole supplies a glomerulus.  The smooth muscle in the wall of the vessel serves as a stopcock to influence the rate of blood flow to the glomerulus.A glomerulus consists of 20-40 anastomosing capillary loops inside Bowman's capsule. As an afferent arteriole enters Bowman's capsule, it forms 5-8 primary branches with each branch forming a number of capillary loops called a lobule.  Anastomoses occur between capillary loops within a lobule as well as between capillary loops of adjacent lobules.  The capillaries of the glomerulus converge to form the efferent glomerular arteriole.The efferent glomerular arterioles in the outer part of the cortex divide into cortical capillaries, which surround the cortical tubules and form a peritubular plexus.  These blood vessels empty into the cortical venules, which drain into the interlobular veins.  The efferent arterioles of the more deeply situated glomeruli are of larger caliber than those of the outer cortex.  They pass into the medulla (some as far as the papillae of the pyramids) as the vasa rectae.  The vasa rectae are thin-walled blood vessels, which make hairpin loops deep in the medulla.  The ascending limb of each loop returns to the corticomedullary junction to enter an arcuate vein.  The vasa rectae accompany the loops of Henle and are important in the countercurrent mechanism.  Arcuate veins can be seen with the arcuate arteries at the corticomedullary junction.

Smaller, denser nuclei are seen clustered in some of the connective tissue spaces.  These represent both fibroblasts and nucleated blood cells (lymphocytes, monocytes).  Hepatocyte cytoplasm is pink (mildly acidophilic), and cell margins can be seen. This is not always the case, but in the liver, small canals and vascular channels serve to aid in delineating cells.

Sinus endothelial cells are readily seen.   The space between the sinusoidal cells and hepatic cells is the perisinusoidal space of Disse.  It is a lymph channel, which carries lymph to the periphery of the lobule.  Blood in the sinusoids flows in the opposite direction, i.e., toward the central vein.  Attempt to find a bile canaliculus, which is located between the hepatic cells.  Bile canaliculi carry bile toward the periphery of the lobule.  Identify a portal canal in the connective tissue between lobules.  The portal canal contains a bile duct (lined by cuboidal epithelium) and one or more arteries, veins, and lymph vessels.  Some of the triads have multiple bile duct branches and show lymphatic filtration.  Small nerves are also present, but they are difficult to see in routine preparations.  The space between the limiting lamina and the connective tissue of the portal canal is a tissue space called the space of Mall.  Lymph from the space of Disse seeps into this space and then into lymph vessels in the portal canal.  Canals of Hering are the small bile ducts, which lie in the connective tissue just outside the limiting lamina and connect with the bile ducts in portal canals.  They have low cuboidal epithelium and are 15-20 μm in diameter.","thumb":"http://digitalmicro.mc.vanderbilt.edu/WebSlides/Pettepher/B-72/PreviewSlide.jpg","tissue":"Liver","stain":"H&E"},

Using low magnification, identify the three tunics (mucosa, muscularis, and fibrosa), which form the wall.  The mucosa or mucous membrane, consisting of epithelium and lamina propria, is highly folded and has a number of outpockets.  The narrow, star-shaped lumen is lined by transitional epithelium, which is 5-6 cell layers thick.  Under higher magnification, note that the surface layer of cells is larger and darker staining than the deeper cell layers.  Cells of the basal layer are cuboidal to columnar in shape.  The transitional epithelium of the ureter and of the other excretory passageways rests upon a very thin basement membrane, the thinnest in the body.  It was questioned whether transitional epithelium had a basement membrane until one was clearly shown in electron micrographs.The lamina propria has a rather dense appearance and contains an abundance of collagenous fibers.  Numerous elastic fibers are also present; making the lamina propria a stretchable fibroelastic connective tissue, but these fibers cannot be readily visualized without special stains (e.g., Verhoeff).  Besides connective tissue fibers, small veins tending to form a plexus, and various types of connective tissue cells are present in the lamina propria.  Glands are absent.  Note that the lamina propria is of a somewhat looser texture in its deeper portion where the connective tissue fibers intermingle with the bundles of smooth muscle.The regular longitudinal folds of the mucosa, show in cross sectional profile, are characteristic of the ureter.The muscularis of the upper two-thirds of the ureter is divided into inner longitudinal and outer circular layers.  This arrangement of smooth muscle is opposite that of the intestines where inner circular and outer longitudinal layers are present.  The muscularis of the lower one-third of the ureter has inner longitudinal, middle circular, and outer longitudinal layers. Unlike the situation in the gastrointestinal tract, the muscle layers are neither compact nor continuous.

Using low magnification, identify the three tunics (mucosa, muscularis, and fibrosa), which form the wall.  The mucosa or mucous membrane, consisting of epithelium and lamina propria, is highly folded and has a number of outpockets.  The narrow, star-shaped lumen is lined by transitional epithelium, which is 5-6 cell layers thick.  Under higher magnification, note that the surface layer of cells is larger and darker staining than the deeper cell layers.  Cells of the basal layer are cuboidal to columnar in shape.  The transitional epithelium of the ureter and of the other excretory passageways rests upon a very thin basement membrane, the thinnest in the body.  It was questioned whether transitional epithelium had a basement membrane until one was clearly shown in electron micrographs.The lamina propria has a rather dense appearance and contains an abundance of collagenous fibers.  Numerous elastic fibers are also present; making the lamina propria a stretchable fibroelastic connective tissue, but these fibers cannot be readily visualized without special stains (e.g., Verhoeff).  Besides connective tissue fibers, small veins tending to form a plexus, and various types of connective tissue cells are present in the lamina propria.  Glands are absent.  Note that the lamina propria is of a somewhat looser texture in its deeper portion where the connective tissue fibers intermingle with the bundles of smooth muscle.The regular longitudinal folds of the mucosa, show in cross sectional profile, are characteristic of the ureter.The muscularis of the upper two-thirds of the ureter is divided into inner longitudinal and outer circular layers.  This arrangement of smooth muscle is opposite that of the intestines where inner circular and outer longitudinal layers are present.  The muscularis of the lower one-third of the ureter has inner longitudinal, middle circular, and outer longitudinal layers. Unlike the situation in the gastrointestinal tract, the muscle layers are neither compact nor continuous.  Each layer is formed by bundles of smooth muscle separated from each other by large amounts of connective tissue.

{"id":1580,"imageId":1558,"number":"C-4","description":"This H&E specimen was taken from the monkey bladder.  The urinary bladder is an expandable, hollow, muscular sac, which receives urine from the two ureters and temporarily stores it until discharged via the urethra.  Like the ureter, the bladder has three layers (mucosa, muscularis, and fibrosa or serosa) with each layer being much thicker than the corresponding layer of the ureter.The mucosa with its lining of transitional epithelium and underlying lamina propria is rather thick.  The epithelium has 6-8 cell layers, a characteristic of the relaxed (contracted) bladder.  The surface cells, like those frequently seen in the liver, contain multiple amounts of DNA and demonstrate polyploidy.  A thin cuticular border can be seen at the luminal surface of some cells.  The border, as shown by electron microscopy, is produced by tonofilaments, which tend to congregate in the apical cytoplasm.  As part of the cytoskeleton, they provide cellular rigidity, but perhaps a more important function is that they may prevent resorption of the hypertonic urine.  The cells immediately beneath the surface cells are pear-shaped and their apices fit into the facet-like indentations on the underside of the surface cells.  The cells between the surface and basal cell layers make up the intermediate cell layer.  They are smaller, more elongated, and more irregularly shaped than the surface cells.  The basal cell layer is like that in other types of stratified epithelia.  It undergoes mitosis to replenish the cells that are lost at the free surface.The lamina propria, a layer of fibroelastic connective tissue is separated from the epithelium by an indistinct basement membrane, which is rather dense in its superficial portion but becomes looser in texture as the muscularis is approached. It is not unusual to find lymphocytes in abundance in the denser, superficial portion, and some of them may be seen migrating through the epithelium.  A submucosa is not present, although as with the ureter, the looser connective tissue near the muscularis is sometimes referred to as a submucosa.  Glands are absent.  The mucous surface coat that is seen with the electron microscope on the free surface of transitional epithelium is believed to be produced by the surface cells.The muscularis is well developed and, like the epithelium, shows differences in thickness with the expansion or contraction of the bladder.  Three layers of muscle are described (except in the trigone): an inner longitudinal, a middle circular, and an outer longitudinal, but the interlacing of bundles of smooth muscle makes it difficult to differentiate between the layers.  First observe the different bundles of smooth muscle, their direction, and their distribution, and then attempt to group them into layers.  Note the loose connective tissue, blood vessels, and nerves between the smooth muscle bundles.  It is not unusual to find groups of neurons (small ganglia) in the connective tissue, and these are indicative of the innervation of the smooth muscle by the autonomic nervous system.The external covering of the bladder is a fibrosa except on the superior surface where peritoneum is present. Thus the external covering on the superior surface is a serosa.  The outer connective tissue layer of other viscera is also called a serosa if it is covered by the mesothelium of the peritoneum.  From the superior surface of the bladder, it will show the serosa with its mesothelium (simple squamous epithelium), fat, loose connective tissue, blood vessels, and nerves.","thumb":"http://digitalmicro.mc.vanderbilt.edu/WebSlides/Pettepher/C-4/PreviewSlide.jpg","tissue":"Bladder","stain":"H&E"},

The satellite cells (called capsule cells) are derived from neuroectoderm (like the Schwann cells).  They also serve similar functions as the Schwann cells: structural and metabolic support.

{"id":1604,"imageId":1582,"number":"C-13","description":"This is a specimen of rat testis, cut in cross-section and stained with iron hematoxylin and orange G.   This slide is best used to see the histology of the seminiferous tubule.  Notice that the cell types of the seminiferous epithelium are identical around the entire circumference of the seminiferous tubule. This is a feature of rat spermatogenesis that is not mimicked in the human testis.  Spermatogenesis in rats occurs in waves along the length of the tubule so that the components of the tubule are synchronized. This allows you to easily distinguish the different phases of spermatogenesis.   Scan the section and identify the seminiferous tubules. Note the connective tissue in between the tubules. This contains small blood vessels and nests of larger, plumper Leydig cells (aka: Interstitial Cells of Leydig). At higher magnification some of the Leydig cells will appear to have large clear vacuoles. These were areas of steroid hormone storage. The steroids are dissolved during tissue processing. Looking at the seminiferous tubules, this stain nicely shows the thin basement membrane upon which the basal layer of germ cells rests. Look for a good example.Using their position in the epithelium, their nuclear size, and nuclear morphology, pick out cells in the various stages of spermatogenesis (spermatogonia, primary spermatocyte, secondary spermatocyte) and spermiogenesis (spermatid-spermatozoan).  Remember that not all stages will be seen in a single seminiferous tubule in cross section.  If you have trouble identifying some of the cell types, compare this slide to slide C16. The thinner section and different staining in slide C16 makes identification of some stages much clearer than in this slide.Spermatogonia, the undifferentiated germ cells, are located at the periphery of the tubule.  Like other germ cells, they contain spherical nuclei.  It may be possible to distinguish between some of the type A and type B spermatogonia by noting the 1-2 nucleoli at the nuclear periphery in type A spermatogonia, and the single, more centrally located nucleolus in type B spermatogonia.  Recall that some type A cells become type B cells, but many type A cells are concerned with maintaining a residual spermatogonial line for future mitoses.  On the other hand, all type B cells and their progeny will eventually differentiate into primary spermatocytes.Primary spermatocytes are found in the middle of the seminiferous tubule, and they are the largest cells within the tubule.  One primary spermatocyte results from the growth and differentiation of one type B spermatogonium.  The spherical nuclei of primary spermatocytes often show clumps or spirems of chromatin.Secondary spermatocytes arise from the division of primary spermatocytes. Secondary spermatocytes are located near the lumen of the seminiferous tubule and are about one-half the diameter of primary spermatocytes.  The secondary spermatocyte, almost as soon as it is formed, undergoes the second maturation division to form two spermatids.  Thus, there are few secondary spermatocytes in the seminiferous tubule and they may be difficult to find for study.Spermatids and the developing spermatozoan are located near the lumen of the tubule. The nuclei and tails of the spermatozoan are particularly obvious with this staining.","thumb":"http://digitalmicro.mc.vanderbilt.edu/WebSlides/Pettepher/C-13/PreviewSlide.jpg","tissue":"Testis","stain":"Iron hematoxylin and orange g"},

The thinner section provides a sharper view of the testicular architecture. You can clearly see the fibro-elastic connective tissue surrounding each seminiferous tubule.  This connective tissue contains elongate fibroblasts and collagen fibers.  Compare this layer with the same area in slide C13 from the rat.  In the angular interstitial spaces formed between several seminiferous tubules you can see collections of the Leydig cells.  These are distinguished from fibroblasts by their more rhomboid shape, round nuclei, and vacuolization.  The vacuolization is very clear in these thin sections.  Also identify blood vessels within the connective tissue layer. Within the seminiferous tubules, identify Sertoli cells (aka: sustentacular cells of Sertoli).  Most of their cytoplasm will be hidden but you can recognize their nuclei, which are ovoid and pale and general have a prominent nucleolus.  Look for the nuclei of Sertoli cells, which are quite numerous, between the mid-region of the seminiferous epithelium and the basement membrane. It should be easy in this slide to locate Spermatogonia, Spermatocytes, Spermatids, and Spermatozoan using the same criteria used in slide C13.  The tails of the spermatozoa can be seen but they will not be as obvious as in slide C13.  Note that the developmental stages are not synchronized throughout a single region of the seminiferous tubule as they were in the rat.

The rete testis can be seen within a mass of connective tissue (the mediastinum). It is lined by a simple epithelium consisting of random areas of squamous, cuboidal, and columnar cells.  Non-human primates have a central rather than peripheral mediastinum; therefore the rete is located in the center of the mass of seminiferous tubules.  In both humans and monkeys the dense irregular connective tissue of the tunica albuginea thickens posteriorly and projects inward to form the mediastinum.  This is the only entry to the testis for ducts, blood vessels, and nerves.  From the mediastinum, thin connective tissue septa with blood vessels radiate into the testis and divide it incompletely into lobules. In the region where the seminiferous tubules are close to the mediastinum you can see straight tubules (aka: tubuli recti), which resemble the seminiferous tubules except they have a simple epithelium.  This is the area where the seminiferous tubules transform and coalesce into the rete testis.

The underlying tunica albuginea is thinner than the comparable layer of the testis.  Abnormal thickening of this layer may prevent follicle rupture and ovulation.\tScan the section and identify the primordial follicles that are usually located near the tunica albuginea.  These follicles will be surrounded by flattened follicular cells.  The primary oocyte (about 20 mm in diameter) within the follicle has pale, granular cytoplasm, a pale, round nucleus, and a dark nucleolus.  Identify the other types of follicles that are present. Primary follicles result from growth of primordial follicles. They can be subdivided into unilaminar primary follicles and multilaminar primary follicles.  The unilaminar primary follicle has entered the initial stage of growth due to stimulation by FSH.  It resembles a primordial follicle except that it is surrounded by a layer of cuboidal to columnar granulosa cells.  The multilaminar primary follicle is surrounded by two or more layers of granulosa cells, which lack an antrum.  The primary oocyte is growing and may reach a diameter of 100 mm or more in the multilaminar primary follicle. A distinct zona pellucida can be seen in multilaminar follicles.  It is a gel-like membrane, rich in glycoprotein, interposed between the oocyte and the granulosa cells.Further growth of a multilaminar follicle leads to the formation of a secondary follicle, which is characterized by an antrum.  The antrum is a space among the follicular cells, which appears when follicles reach about 0.2 mm in diameter.  The antrum is filled in life with a fluid, the liquor folliculi, and gradually increases in size by the accumulation of fluid.  You should also be able to identify the following in this slide:1. Oocyte.  The oocyte usually reaches its full size (100-150 mm in diameter) in the primary follicle, but the cytoplasm is more granular in the oocyte of the large secondary follicle.2. Follicular cells are the granulosa cells of the large secondary follicle and are subclassified according to their location as follows:a. Granulosa membrane (aka: membrane granulosum, aka: stratum granulosum)--consists of 3-4 layers of cells, which line the fluid-filled antrum.b. Cumulus oophorus (aka: germ hill, aka: discus proligerus)--consists of a mound of cells that attach to the granulosa membrane, extend into the antrum, and contain the oocyte.c. Corona radiata--consists of the one or more cell layers of the cumulus that lie next to the zona pellucida of the oocyte.  Processes of these cells extend through the zona pellucida to the ovum.3. Glassy membrane.  This is the basement membrane, which lies between the granulosa membrane and the theca interna.  Because it is thin, it is easier to identify in the larger secondary follicles.4. Theca interna.  This layer is characterized by polyhedral cells and numerous blood vessels.  The cells develop from stromal cells and have cytological features similar to other cells, which produce steroid hormones.  They secrete estrogens.5. Theca externa.  This layer contains spindle-shaped cells, which do not appear capable of hormone production.  The theca externa blends with the theca interna and with the ovarian stroma.","thumb":"http://digitalmicro.mc.vanderbilt.edu/WebSlides/Pettepher/C-39/PreviewSlide.jpg","tissue":"Ovary","stain":"Trichrome"},

Granulosa lutein cells (about 25 mm in diameter) constitute the bulk of the wall.  These large cells secrete progesterone and represent cells of the granulosa membrane, which have undergone hypertrophy.  The small theca lutein cells (about 12 mm in diameter) can be seen at the periphery of the corpus and in the connective tissue of the folds.

{"id":1576,"imageId":1554,"number":"C-44","description":"This is an H&E stained spedimen taken from the infundibular portion of the human oviduct.  The wall of the oviduct consists of a mucosa, muscularis, and external serosa. These features can be readily seen in this slide at low magnification. The mucosa has deep thin folds in the infundibular region. The epithelium is simple columnar.  The height of the epithelium is highest in the ampulla (see slides C45 and C46) and is influenced by hormones, being somewhat higher just before ovulation.  There are two types of columnar epithelial cells found in the oviduct, ciliated and nonciliated (aka: peg) cells.  The latter are recognized because their nuclei are near the lumen and their cytoplasm (and sometimes nuclei) bulge into the oviduct lumen.  Peg cells are probably secretory cells.  Ciliated cells predominate, particularly in the infundibulum and ampulla, being slightly less in number as the ampulla grades into the isthmus.  These are probably not separate cell types but rather different states of the same cell type.  Thus, hormonal changes can influence the relative ratios of the two cell types.  A few basal cells with pale cytoplasm and dark nuclei can sometimes be seen located near the basement membrane.  They are undifferentiated cells, which give rise to other cell types.   The lamina propria consists of loose connective tissue and is rich in blood vessels. The lamina propria lacks glands.The smooth muscle in the muscularis is loosely arranged into inner circular and outer longitudinal layers, which are separated by a connective tissue layer. The outer longitudinal layer is best defined in the isthmus becoming less distinct as you approach the fimbriae.  It may be unrecognizable in the infundibulum.  See if you can discern two distinct muscle layers in this section.The serosa or outermost layer of loose connective tissue contains blood vessels, lymphatics, and nerves. The serosa is lined by simple squamous layer of mesothelial cells.

At low magnification you can see that the endometrium is divided into two layers. Near the lumen, the stroma of the endometrium appears lighter, this is the functional layer (aka: Stratum Functionalis).  The deeper layer is darker in color because the hematoxylin stained nuclei of the stroma are closer together.  This is the basal layer (aka: Stratum Basalis).  Note that the glands are relative straight and project through the length of the endometrium with some even penetrating into the myometrium.  The surface epithelium contains mostly ciliated cells but some non-ciliated secretory cells are also present. In contrast, the glands are lined primarily by secretory cells.  The epithelium is a simple columnar but may appear stratified (i.e. is a pseudostratified epithelium) in places, particularly in the glands.  This is due to the accumulation of glycogen in the base of the cells, which pushes the nuclei of these cells to a more apical position.  You should also be able to pick out mitotic figures within the glands indicating the rapid proliferation of the endometrium.  Look between the glands for cross sections of the spiral arteries.

Using higher magnification note that the stroma is sparse and most of it lies between the blood vessels and the parenchymal cells.  Macrophages constitute most of the stromal cells.  Examine the cords of cells and note the variability in the percentages of parenchymal cells (chromophobes and chromophils) making up each cord.  Serial sections must be studied to determine accurately the percentages of various cell types in the pars distalis.  Identify in different areas the chromophobes, which have no granulation, a nondescript but not entirely colorless cytoplasm, and indistinct or invisible cell boundaries.  They tend to be centrally located in the cords and comprise about 50% of the cells of the pars distalis. Acidophils, the source of GH and prolactin, have carmine (red to hot pink) or orange colored granules and constitute about 35% of the cells of the pars distalis.  The remaining 15% of the cells with blue or slightly purple granules are basophils, the source of TSH, FSH, LH (ICSH), and ACTH.  With more refined staining techniques, immunohistochemistry, and electron microscopy, the chromophils can be further subdivided and the cellular source of each hormone can be identified.  Locate the pars intermedia with its cysts or follicles of various sizes and its laminae or irregular groups of basophilic cells.  Some of the cysts are lined by flattened cells, while others are surrounded by cuboidal cells which range from pale to basophilic in staining intensity. Lumina of the follicles contain a colloid-like material.  Note that the basophilic cells, the source of MSH, are not confined to the pars intermedia, many have migrated into the pars nervosa.Study the pars tuberalis if it is present on your section.  Blood vessels are especially abundant in this subdivision of the adenohypophysis.

Note its resemblance to lymphatic tissue.  Closer inspection shows that the gland is composed of cords of cells, some of which are rather thick, separated by connective tissue septa.  Fat cells can be seen in the connective tissue septa and among the parenchymal cells.  Identify the two types of parenchymal cells: chief cells and oxyphil cells. Most chief cells in this preparation should be classified as light chief cells.  They are small cells with pale cytoplasm and relatively large vesicular nuclei.  Oxyphils are larger than chief cells and have pink cytoplasm.  They are further characterized by nuclei, often eccentrically located, which are smaller and darker than nuclei of chief cells.  Oxyphils may be scattered singly among the chief cells or they may occur in groups consisting of several cells. Groups of oxyphils are easiest to find with low, but diligent searching may be required to locate them because of their scarcity in this preparation.  The small number of oxyphils probably indicates that the organ was from a relatively young individual.  They do not appear in the gland until about the 4th year. On the other hand, chief cells are the source of Parathyroid hormone.","thumb":"http://digitalmicro.mc.vanderbilt.edu/WebSlides/Pettepher/C-81/PreviewSlide.jpg","tissue":"Thyroid and parathyroid gland","stain":"H&E"},
{"id":1542,"imageId":1520,"number":"C-91","description":"This H&E specimen contains olfactory and respiratory epithelium.  This is a section of the nasal septum and conchae lined with primarily olfactory epithelium.  Since it is difficult to obtain human olfactory epithelium, this sample is from an animal, which has an enormous olfactory area.  Compare the thin respiratory (nasal) epithelium found to the right of the specimen with the features of the thick olfactory mucosa, the majority and on the left side of the specimen. Note that wherever the epithelium is olfactory in type, it is underlain by a thick lamina propria with numerous glands and bundles of axons, which will give rise to the olfactory nerve.Examine the respiratory mucosa and compare it to olfactory mucosa on the same slide, noting the following differences:1. Thickness of epithelium.  Olfactory epithelium is thicker than respiratory epithelium although both types are pseudo-stratified columnar.2. Goblet cells.  They are present in respiratory epithelium but absent in olfactory epithelium.3. Cilia. Respiratory epithelium has numerous true cilia while olfactory epithelium has a few cilia associated with the olfactory cells, but these, as shown by electron microscopy, are atypical.4. Basement membrane.  Adult respiratory epithelium rests on a thick basement membrane. It is thin beneath olfactory epithelium.  This difference may not be apparent in your section since the section was taken from a young monkey.5. Olfactory glands of Bowman.  These glands are present in olfactory mucosa; absent in respiratory mucosa.  Although glands do occur in respiratory mucosa, they are fewer in number and they are not the glands of Bowman.6. Fila olfactoria.  These special nerves are present in olfactory mucosa but absent in respiratory mucosa.7. Pigment.  Pigment is present in olfactory mucosa (sustentacular cells and glands of Bowman); absent in respiratory mucosa.","thumb":"http://digitalmicro.mc.vanderbilt.edu/WebSlides/Pettepher/C-91/PreviewSlide.jpg","tissue":"Olfactory and respiratory epithelium","stain":"H&E"},
{"id":1541,"imageId":1519,"number":"C-93","description":"This H&E specimen was taken from the monkey inner ear.  Attempt to find the locations of the two sensory ganglia, the spiral and vestibular ganglia, associated with the inner ear.  The spiral ganglion can be found in the modiolus (central bony component) of the cochlea, and the vestibular ganglion is located outside the bony casing of the middle ear.  The vestibular ganglion shows the basic characteristics of a somatosensory ganglion, including nerve fibers coursing through the middle of the ganglion with majority of the closely-packed cell bodies of the ganglion aggregating on the periphery, centrally-located nuclei in the cell bodies, and satellite cells supporting the cell bodies of this sensory ganglion.Identify the organ of Corti, inner and outer pillar cells, inner and outer phalangeal cells, inner and outer hair cells, border cells, and cells of Hensen.  The inner and outer hair cells are similar to type I and type II hair cells of the maculae, but lack the lateral, non-motile cilia.","thumb":"http://digitalmicro.mc.vanderbilt.edu/WebSlides/Pettepher/C-93/PreviewSlide.jpg","tissue":"Inner ear","stain":"H&E"},
{"id":1540,"imageId":1518,"number":"C-95","description":"This H&E saggital (longitudinal) specimen of the eye was taken from a rabiit.  It contains odd bits of precipitates that are randomly distributed over the slide.  Ignore them.  The cornea is the portion of the eye anterior to the lens and is surrounded by epithelial layers at its anterior and posterior margins.  What type of epithelium is found in both places?  The corneal stroma is comprised of a dense regular connective tissue, but the alternating layers (with different orientation) may not be appreciated by light microscopy.Bowman’s membrane, a thin, acellular membrane, separates the epithelium from the stroma.  The posterior surface is lined by a simple squamous to cuboidal epithelium.  Descemet’s membrane separates the simple epithelium from the stroma. The sclera is continuous with the cornea and is similar to it in structure, except that it is not transparent.  The epithelium of the conjunctiva covers the anterior surface of the sclera.  The stroma is composed of thick collagen fibers.  Melanocytes are found in the deepest layer or suprachoroid lamina.\tAlso, though not seen, the vitreous body located in the posterior segment of the eye (large white space behind the lens) is filled with a mucous type of CT or gel.  Its function is to help direct light onto the retina as well as to push on the retina so that it doesn't detach from the overlying CT.Pigmented epithelium.  This layer is adjacent to the choroid and attached to it. Processes of the pigmented epithelial cells surround the tips of the outer segments of the rods and cones and are responsible for phagocytosis of the lamellae, which are cast off the tips of the rods.  In the case of retinal detachment the pigmented epithelium remains attached to the choroid.2. Rod and cone outer segments.  This layer is composed of the outer segments of the photoreceptor cells.  The cones are shorter, darker, and thicker with their nuclei in a single row just internal to the external limiting membrane.  Rods are paler, thinner, and longer than cones. Except at the fovea centralis, the light must pass through all the other intervening layers to reach the outer segments of the rods and cones.3. External limiting membrane. The external limiting membrane consists of junctional complexes between glial cells (of Muller) and the rods and cones.  It appears as a narrow line just below (internal to) the rod and cone outer segments.4. Outer nuclear layer consists of the nuclei of the rods and cones. The outer layer of nuclei, which are larger and paler belong to the cones.  The smaller, darker, more numerous nuclei are those of the rods.5. Outer plexiform layer composed of axons of rod and cone cells and dendrites of bipolar neurons.6. Inner nuclear layer consists of the nuclei of bipolar neurons, association neurons (horizontal cells and amacrine cells), and Muller cells.7. Inner plexiform layer consists of axons of bipolar cells and dendrites of ganglion cells.  Processes of some association neurons are also present.8. Ganglion cell layer consists of cell bodies of ganglion cells, which are multipolar neurons.9. Nerve fiber layer consists of ganglion cell axons, which converge posteriorly to form the optic nerve.10. Internal limiting membrane consists of the basal processes of Muller cells and their basement membrane.  The internal limiting membrane separates the retina from the vitreous body.","thumb":"http://digitalmicro.mc.vanderbilt.edu/WebSlides/Pettepher/C-95/PreviewSlide.jpg","tissue":"Eye","stain":"H&E"},
{"id":1539,"imageId":1517,"number":"C-96","description":"This H&E sagittal specimen of the eye is similar to C95.  Note the dense, regular CT of the corneal stroma.  It consists of layers of collagen fibers that are arranged in overlapping layers.  This precise arrangement allows of the transparent nature of the cornea.  That edges of the corneal are covered by an epithelium.  Is the epithelial type the same all around the edges of the cornea?The middle tunic, the tunica vasculosa or uvea, consists of three structures: the iris, the ciliary body and the choroid.The iris, the anterior-most portion of the uvea, is a pigmented disc with a central aperture, the pupil.  The pupil controls the amount of light, which enters the eye and stimulates the retina.The ciliary body constitutes the intermediate portion of the uvea extending from the root of the iris anteriorly to the edge of the photosensitive retina or ora serrata posteriorly.  The lens is suspended from the anterior portion of the ciliary body by means of the zonula fibers or suspensory ligaments.  Focusing of the lens is accomplished by means of the ciliary muscle.  Contraction of the muscle relieves the tension on the suspensory ligaments and allows the lens to round up, bringing near objects into focus.The most posterior portion of the uvea, the choroid, lines the back of the eye as far forward as the ora serrata.  The choroid is a highly vascular nutritive layer, which supports the retina and by virtue of its pigment cells (melanophores) helps absorb light, which has passed through the retina.","thumb":"http://digitalmicro.mc.vanderbilt.edu/WebSlides/Pettepher/C-96/PreviewSlide.jpg","tissue":"Eye","stain":"H&E"},
