	{"id":99,"name":"Introduction to the Histology Laboratory 7.31.12","description":"This lesson introduces you to how specimens in the virtual slide set have been prepared.  You will learn how to interpret different histological sections and determine why certain stains are utilized to visualize and distinguish different features within the cell, tissue or organ being examined."},
{"id":100,"name":"Cells and Tissues in Routine Preparations; Cellular Organelles and Inclusions 7.31.12","description":"In this laboratory period, you should become acquainted with the appearance of routine preparations of specimens and be able to compare the staining characteristics with other methods used.  You should also be able to discuss why certain organelles have an affinity for the stain utilized to visualize them ."},
{"id":101,"name":"Epithelium and Surface Specializations 8.9.12","description":"Epithelium is one of the four basic tissues of the body.  The cells present in this tissue form sheets that line the external and internal surfaces of each organ that you will study in Cell and Tissue Biology and Pathology.  There are 2 classifications of \"surface epithelium\", simple or stratified, which are distinguished based on the number of layers of cells present in the tissue.   Each classification can then be further divided into various sub-categories based on the shape of the cells  in the layer found closest to the luminal or external surface of the organ. Epithelia also can exist in the form of glands.  During embryonic development, surface epithelia invaginates into the underlying connective tissue (another basic tissue type) where it proliferates and specializes to form the parenchyma of glands, such as those of the skin and gastrointestinal tract. Thus, epithelium is designated as a lining and a secretory tissue.  At the completion of this lesson, you should be able to distinguish between the different types of simple and stratified epithelia as well as identify any surface specialization that is present on the apical surface of the cells forming the epithelial layer."},
{"id":103,"name":"Glandular Epithelium and Salivary Glands 8.22.12","description":"This type of epithelium is formed when the overlying surface epithelium invaginates into the underlying connective tissue layer and forms secretory and ductal units that collectively are termed \"glands\".  The cells found within the secretory and ductal components are usually cuboidal or columnar in shape and can either be simple (secretory units and smaller ducts) or stratified (excretory ducts).  The characteristic features of the cells comprising the secretory units (acini or tubules) will be different depending upon the type of secretory product being manufactured.  In this lesson, you will learn how to distinguish the various types of glands based on their shape and staining characteristics."},
{"id":104,"name":"Connective and Adipose Tissue 8.29.12","description":"Connective Tissue (CT) is the second basic tissue type that will be studied in this block and by far the most extensive and complicated of the 4 basic tissues that comprise the human body.  It is classified as the \"supporting tissue\" of the body and is found in many different varieties throughout the body.  CT can be found in \"embryonic\" and \"adult\" forms.  In the embryo, mesenchymal cells migrate from the mesoderm into the spaces between the germ layers to form a loosely arranged network of stellate cells, which collectively constitute the mesenchyme.  Mesenchyme has multiple developmental potentialities and is the forerunner of all types of connective tissue.  Its derivatives include connective tissue proper, cartilage, bone, blood, smooth muscle and endothelium.  We will study each of these CT derivatives over several laboratory sessions throughout MFM and SFD.  In this lesson, you will focus on learning the two types of Connective Tissue Proper, loose and dense CT.    Both types of CT proper are characterized by cells and fibers embedded in a soft ground substance. The components of connective tissue proper, as in other types of connective tissue, are cells, fibers, and ground substance. The relative number of cells vs. the number of fibers and amount of ground substance determines whether or not the tissue is loose or dense CT.  By the end of this lesson, you should be able to distinguish between loose and dense CT and be familiar with the cells and fiber types that comprise both."}
